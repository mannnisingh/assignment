    "\n",
    "Reuse of Code: Once you've defined a function, you can use it multiple times in your program without having to rewrite the same code. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy, making programs more efficient and easier to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away complex operations behind a simple interface. Users of the function only need to know what the function does, not how it achieves the result. This abstraction makes the code more readable and helps to hide unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Breaking down a program into functions can enhance readability. Functions act as building blocks, and a well-named function can serve as documentation, providing a clear understanding of what a specific part of the code does.\n",

    "Scoping: Functions create their own scope, which helps in organizing variables and preventing naming conflicts. This improves the maintainability of the code and reduces the chances of unintended side effects.\n",

    "Testing and Debugging: Functions make it easier to test and debug code. Since functions perform specific tasks, you can isolate and test them independently, making it simpler to identify and fix issues.\n",

    "Ans.A **function** and a **function call** are two related but distinct concepts in programming:\n",

    "   - A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks.\n",
    "   - It is defined using the `def` keyword in languages like Python.\n",
    "   - It has a name, parameters (optional), and a body of code that gets executed when the function is called.\n",

    "    parts of your program.\n",

    "2. **Function Call:**\n",
    "   - A function call is the act of invoking or executing a specific function to perform its defined task.\n",
    "   - It involves using the function's name followed by parentheses, and providing values for any required parameters.\n",

    "In summary, a function is a reusable block of code with a specific purpose, defined using the `def` keyword, while a function \n",

    "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block:** This is where you place the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within this block, \n",
    "    the control flow will immediately jump to the corresponding `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`except` Block:** This block contains the code that will be executed if the specified exception (or any exception derived \n",

    "type, which catches most built-in exceptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / x\n",

    "   - The `except` clause defines the code that will be executed if a specified exception (or any exception derived from it) \n",
    "occurs within the corresponding `try` block.\n",
    "   - It allows you to handle exceptions gracefully, providing alternative actions or error messages instead of letting the \n",
    "    program crash.\n",
    "   - You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       result = 10 / x\n",
    "       print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero. Please enter a non-zero number.\")\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(\"An unexpected error occurred:\", e)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `try` clause contains the code that may raise an exception, and the `except` clause(s) provide a way to handle \n",
    "those exceptions, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors rather than crashing."
